# Local library

*Note: this is an older project that I had deleted from GitHub. This repository is a revival of that old project.*

This is a simple app where the user can add books to a library and keep track of the ones that they've read or still have to read.
The live version of this project can be found [here](https://locallibrary.niconap.dev/).
